Consider minimum pwm to move the robot in arduino/main.ino

DWA planner failed to produce path, due to local costmap global frame set to odom?

Control loop missed its desired rate, due to high computational cost:
- decrease controller frequency in move_base config
- try Jetson MAXN mode
- try run '$ jetson clocks' to use maximum clock speed
- set 'enable_homotopy_class_planning' to false in TEB config (requires more resources since multiple traj are optimized at once)

TEB planner couldn't find feasible trajectory:
- could caused by low 'global_plan_viapoint_sep', it might pull the robot into obstacles since it tries to stick to global plan. Try high value like 1.0 or completely disable it (-0.1).
- decrease 'feasibility_check_no_poses' to 3 or less (not a proper fix)

Obstacles are not cleared completely in costmap:
- increase raytrace range
- setup costmap layer properly
- try set 'always_send_full_costmap' to true

HIGH interrupt in arduino could cause error in rosserial connection.
